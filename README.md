## Running Locally

Clone the repository into your directory. 

Once in the cloned directory run `npm install` in terminal to dowloand dependencies. 

`npm start` should run the project locally

## Important: Before running locally

If you want to run the project locally, 
You need to create a Google Maps API Key. 
Create a new API key from the Google developer console making sure that Maps JavaScript API has been enabled. Create .env.local file in the root directory. Then save the Google Maps API Key into a new ENV var with the name REACT_APP_API_KEY.
